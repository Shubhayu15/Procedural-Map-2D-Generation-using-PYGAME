## üéØ Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame library

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubhayu15/Procedural-Map-2D-Generation-using-PYGAME.git
cd Procedural-Map-2D-Generation-using-PYGAME
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
python main.py
```

## üéÆ How to Play

### Maze Editor Mode
- **Left Click**: Toggle walls/paths
- **Enter**: Generate new maze with current seed
- **R**: Generate maze with random seed
- **C**: Clear the grid
- **Play Button**: Switch to 3D exploration mode

### Exploration Mode

### Maze Generation
The game uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate perfect mazes, ensuring every location is reachable and there are no loops. Each maze is uniquely determined by its seed, allowing for reproducible layouts.

### Raycasting Engine
The 3D view is achieved through raycasting, similar to classic games like Wolfenstein 3D:
- FOV (Field of View): 60 degrees
- Dynamic wall shading based on distance
- Optimized ray calculation for smooth performance

## üé® Customization

You can modify these constants in the code to customize your experience:

```python
CELL_SIZE = 22        # Size of grid cells
GRID_WIDTH = 33       # Maze width
GRID_HEIGHT = 33      # Maze height
FOV = math.pi / 3     # Field of view
MOVE_SPEED = 2        # Player movement speed
```
